def lazy_matrix_mul(m_a, m_b):
    """
    Multiplies two matrices using NumPy's matmul function and returns the result.

    Parameters:
    m_a (list of lists of int/float): The first matrix, must be a list of lists of integers or floats.
    m_b (list of lists of int/float): The second matrix, must be a list of lists of integers or floats.

    Returns:
    numpy.ndarray: The resulting matrix product of m_a and m_b.

    Raises:
    ValueError: If the matrices m_a and m_b cannot be multiplied due to incompatible dimensions.
    TypeError: If either m_a or m_b contains elements that are not integers or floats, or if scalar operands are used.

    Examples:
    >>> lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[3], [4]])
    array([[11]])

    >>> lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8], [9, 10], [11, 12]])
    array([[ 58,  64],
           [139, 154]])

    >>> lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2]], [[3, 4]])
    ValueError: m_a and m_b can't be multiplied

    Notes:
    - The function requires NumPy to be installed. Install it using 'pip3 install numpy==1.15.0'.
    - The number of columns in the first matrix (m_a) must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix (m_b) for multiplication to be possible.
    - The resulting matrix will have the same number of rows as m_a and the same number of columns as m_b.
